# 100DaysofCoding-Day7-Challenge-Hangman

This challenge was actually very stimulating. The concept of building a hangman games seems simple enough when you make it into a flowchart, but things can quickly get complex as you go on. Was proud of the way the game turned out and as i continue to get better at programming, i would love to revisit it and see what changes i can make to the code.
